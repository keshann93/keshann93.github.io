### Introduction to commonly used ES6 features

JavaScript has progressed a ton in the recent years. If you’re learning JavaScript in 2017 and you haven’t touched ES6, you’re missing out on an easier way to read and write JavaScript.

Don’t worry if you’re not a master at JavaScript yet. You don’t need to be awesome at JavaScript to take advantage of the added bonuses ES6 gives you. In this article, I want to share with you eight ES6 features I use daily as a developer to help you ease into the new syntax.

### A list of ES6 features
First off, ES6 is a huge update to JavaScript
- Arrows
- Classes
- Enhanced object literals
- Template strings
- Destructuring
- Default + rest + spread
- Let + const
- Iterators + for..of
- Generators
- Unicode
- Modules
- Module loaders
- Map + set + weakmap + weakset
- Proxies
- Symbols
- Subclassable built-ins
- Promises
- Math + number + string + array + object apis
- Binary and octal literals
- Reflect api
- Tail calls

Don’t let this big list of features scare you away from ES6. You don’t need to know everything right away. I’m going to share with you eight of these features that I use on a daily basis. They are:
1. Let and const
2. Arrow functions
3. Default parameters
4. Destructuring
5. Rest parameter and spread operator
6. Enhanced object literals
7. Template literals
8. Promises

We’ll go through the eight features in the follow sections. For now, I’ll go through the first five features. I’ll add the rest as I go along in the next couple of weeks.
By the way, browser support for ES6 is amazing. Almost everything is supported natively if you code for the latest browsers (Edge, and latest versions of FF, Chrome and Safari).

You don’t need fancy tooling like Webpack if you wanted to write ES6. If browser support is lacking in your case, you can always fall back on polyfills created by the community. Just google them :)
With that, let’s jump into the first feature.
