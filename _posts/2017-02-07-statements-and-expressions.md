### Introduction

This blog post is an initial effort for many series of post that I am planning to post based on what I study daily. I have chosen to start recaping all basics related to Javascript. Here I am with my 1st post descibing about **Statements** and **Expressions** in Javascript. I would like to give a brief intro into programming relating to the content that I am focusing to explain with this post before I dive into the actual content. 

In simple english **A program is set of instructions** created to guide computers on what task to be performed by them. Though you write a program you need to adhere to rules and valid formats that are defined for it and they are called as **syntax**. This concept of programming/computer langauge is similar to other languages that we use to communicate. Lets take English as example where it defines correct spelling and meaning for words, and your instrucuted to create proper sentences with valide grammer which include punctuations and other string literals to add meaning for sentence. Same way all programming languages works too, its the duty of the programmer to learn them properly to make their life easy. Lets without any delay dive into the acutal content.

### Statements

In a programming language, a set of words, numbers and operators togather that perform speciic task is defined as a **statement**. For e.g. in Javascript a statement would possibly look like below 

> a = b / 3;
